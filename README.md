<h2>Goal</h2>
The goal of this project was to learn how to use a GUI in Java and package it into a user friendly piece of software. I decided to use Swing because of it's simplicity and wide adoption.

<h2>Design</h2>
In using Swing I learned how to setup frames, and fill them with elements in a way that would reflect my own vision. I discovered how improtant it was to have a design in mind before beginning, as having a certain layout in mind would make the process much more efficient.
For example, the default layout of my frames is Border Layout, but for the main panel of each frame I chose to use a null layout so I could place each element exactly how I wanted it.
This however did come at the cost of making the window unable to be resized so the user could not unintentionally ruin the design, but this is a choice I made intentionally after weighing the pros and cons of the layouts in regard to my own intentions.
Although not the focus of this project, the actual software itself is a simple Bank Application that can create and store multiple bank accounts and allow the user to view and modify their contents.
I tried to take advantage of some of the new features that were now availible to me in using a GUI, such as an image for the icon and sounds to play when interacting.
This then led me to my next (and most unexpected) challenge which was the process of actually creating the executable file to package for the end user.
In creating the jar file, I had to learn how to streamline my use of resource files to allow for the jar file to be able to access them, and I had particular issue regarding sound.

<h2>Reflection</h2>
While it isn't the most impressive piece of software ever shipped, I'm really glad I took the time to learn the process of actually being able to ship a piece of software that doesn't need to be opened through an IDE.
Even the simple things such as creating my own icon for a fictional bank I invented reminded me of why creating sofware is of such interest to me.
At the end of the day its thinking about the user who will see and interact with the thing you created that inspires me to create new things.
